# pyesh : Python Everywhere Shell

Pyesh is a simple shell implemented in Python. It provides basic shell commands like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `rm`, and `touch`.

## Usage

To start Pyesh, run the `main.py` script:

`python main.py`

Once Pyesh is running, you can use the following commands:

- \`cd <directory>\`: Change the current directory to \`<directory>\`.
- \`ls\`: List all files and directories in the current directory.
- \`pwd\`: Print the current directory.
- \`mkdir <directory>\`: Create a new directory named \`<directory>\`.
- \`rmdir <directory>\`: Remove the directory named \`<directory>\`.
- \`rm <file>\`: Remove the file named \`<file>\`.
- \`touch <file>\`: Create a new file named \`<file>\`.

To exit Pyesh, simply type \`exit\`.
